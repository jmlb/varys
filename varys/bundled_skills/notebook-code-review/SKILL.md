# Notebook Code Review Skill

You are performing a **static code quality review** of a Jupyter notebook.
Focus exclusively on whether the code is correct, maintainable, and will run
reliably. Do NOT comment on data science methodology, statistical choices, or
model selection — those are out of scope.

## Severity Levels

Classify every finding under exactly one severity:

| Emoji | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🔴 | CRITICAL | Will break on fresh kernel restart or crash during execution |
| 🟡 | HIGH | Likely to cause bugs, data loss, or hard-to-debug failures |
| 🟠 | MEDIUM | Reduces maintainability or hides subtle problems |
| 🔵 | LOW | Style / clarity issues; won't cause failures but should be addressed |
| ℹ️ | INFORMATIONAL | Observations with no immediate action required |

## What to Check

### 1. Execution Order
- Variables used before they are defined in notebook order
- Cells with non-linear dependencies (run in wrong order)
- Variables overwritten in unexpected ways
- State left by deleted cells (hidden-state bugs)

### 2. Syntax & Logic
- Undefined variables / NameErrors waiting to happen
- Typos in variable or function names
- Incorrect function call signatures
- Missing imports
- Logic errors (off-by-one, inverted conditions)
- Unreachable code

### 3. Error Handling
- `pd.read_csv()` / file I/O without try/except
- No column existence checks after loading data
- No empty-DataFrame guard before `.iloc[0]` or similar
- Division without zero check
- Dictionary access without `.get()` where key may be absent

### 4. Code Quality
- Magic numbers that need a named constant
- Code blocks duplicated > 3 lines (extract to function)
- Cells > 50 lines that should be split
- Row-by-row loops over DataFrames (use vectorised operations)
- Redundant `df.copy()` or repeated data-loading calls

### 5. Import Organisation
- Unused imports
- Imports scattered across cells (all imports should be in the first cell)
- Missing imports (library used but not imported)
- Deprecated APIs (e.g., `sklearn.cross_validation`, `pd.Panel`)

### 6. Naming Conventions
- Single-letter or cryptic names in non-trivial logic (e.g., `x2`, `df2`, `temp`)
- Inconsistent naming (snake_case vs camelCase in the same notebook)
- Python keywords used as variable names (`list`, `type`, `input`)

### 7. Resource Management
- Files opened but never closed (use `with` statements)
- Large intermediate DataFrames not deleted after use
- Database connections not closed

## Output Rules

Each finding must state:
1. **Issue type** and exact cell location (e.g., `[Cell 4]`)
2. **Description** — what is wrong
3. **Why it matters** — concrete consequence if not fixed
4. **Suggestion** — specific actionable fix; include a code snippet when a
   direct code replacement exists and that fix belongs in `steps[]`

If a finding has a corresponding entry in `steps[]`, end the finding with
exactly this line:
`[Fix available — see panel below]`

If there are no issues in a severity section, write `None.` for that section.

If the notebook has no significant issues overall, write:
`✅ No significant code quality issues found.`
and return an empty `steps` array.

## steps[] Rules

Only include steps that are **direct cell replacements or new import cells**.
Do NOT include:
- Execution-order reordering (describe in chatResponse only)
- Renaming suggestions (too context-dependent)
- Structural refactoring (too risky to auto-apply)

Each step must contain the **complete, runnable cell content** — not just the
changed lines. Set `autoExecute: false` on every step.
Maximum 10 steps.

# Notebook Annotation Skill

You are annotating a notebook by inserting numbered title + description cells before
code cells. Follow the **two-phase protocol** below without skipping either phase.
Violating the ordering rules will produce an incorrect notebook.

---

## PHASE 1 — Pre-scan (do this mentally before generating any steps)

Before writing a single operation step, scan the notebook context and build a complete
picture:

### 1a. Find existing titled sections
Walk through every cell in order. A cell is already "titled" if it is:
- A MARKDOWN cell that starts with `#`, `##`, or `###` AND contains a number
  (e.g. `## 1.`, `## 2. Data Loading`, `### 1.2 Feature Engineering`).

Record each titled cell as: `{ cell: "#N", index: N-1, number: "N" or "N.M", heading: "..." }`

### 1b. Find code cells that need a title
Walk through every CODE cell. A code cell DOES NOT need a new title if the
immediately preceding cell is already a titled markdown cell.
A code cell DOES need a new title if:
- It has no preceding cell at all, OR
- Its preceding cell is another code cell, OR
- Its preceding cell is a markdown cell that is NOT a numbered title.

Record each cell-needing-title as: `{ cell: "#N", index: N-1, needs_title: true }`

### 1c. Build the sequential numbering plan
Take every cell-needing-title from step 1b, in ascending order.
Assign section numbers sequentially, starting after the highest existing section
number found in step 1a (or starting at 1 if no existing numbers were found).

**WRITE OUT THE PLAN in your reasoning** (not in the output):
```
Existing numbered cells: [list them as #N]
Cells needing titles (ascending): [list them as #N]
Number assignment: #N (index N-1) → "## K. <Short Title>", ...
```

Verify the numbers are strictly sequential (1, 2, 3 … or continuation) before
proceeding to Phase 2. If they are not sequential, fix them before continuing.

## PHASE 2 — Generate insert steps

Now generate the `steps` array. **Critical rules:**

### 2a. Process cells in ASCENDING order
Always iterate from #1 to the last cell. Never jump backwards.

### 2b. Track cumulative index shift
Start with `shift = 0`.
Each time you emit an `insert` step, increment `shift` by 1.
The `cellIndex` for an insert before cell #N is: **(N-1) + shift** (at the
moment you insert it — shift is the count of all inserts already emitted above it).

Example with 3 code cells at #2, #4, #6 (original indices 1, 3, 5):
```
Insert title before #2 (index 1):  cellIndex = 1 + 0 = 1,  shift becomes 1
Insert title before #4 (index 3):  cellIndex = 3 + 1 = 4,  shift becomes 2
Insert title before #6 (index 5):  cellIndex = 5 + 2 = 7,  shift becomes 3
```

### 2c. Title cell format
```markdown
## N. Short Descriptive Title
```
- Use `##` for top-level sections (not `#` which is reserved for the notebook title,
  not `###` which is for subsections).
- Title: 3–6 words, action-oriented (e.g. "Load and Inspect Data", "Train Model",
  "Evaluate Results").
- No trailing period after the title.

### 2d. Description cell format (when user asks for a description before each code cell)
If the user asked for a short description cell in addition to the title:
Insert ONE additional markdown cell immediately after the title cell (before the code cell):
```markdown
> Brief 1–2 sentence description of what the following code does and why.
```
Use a blockquote (`>`) for descriptions so they are visually distinct from titles.
Each description insert also increments shift by 1.

### 2e. Skip already-titled cells
If a code cell already has a preceding numbered title (identified in Phase 1a), do
NOT insert another title before it. You may still insert a description cell if one
is missing and the user asked for descriptions.

### 2f. autoExecute
All inserted cells are markdown. Set `autoExecute: false` for every step.

## FORMAT EXAMPLE

Notebook before annotation:
```
#1  MARKDOWN  "# My Analysis Notebook"
#2  CODE       import pandas as pd
#3  CODE       df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
#4  MARKDOWN  "## 1. Data Inspection"
#5  CODE       df.head()
#6  CODE       df.describe()
```

Phase 1 scan:
- Existing numbered cells: #4 (index 3) → "1."
- Code cells needing titles: #2 (index 1, no preceding title), #3 (index 2, preceding is code),
  #6 (index 5, preceded by #5 which is CODE → needs title)
- #5 is preceded by #4 which IS a numbered title → #5 does NOT need title
- Number assignment: #2 → "## 2.", #3 → "## 3.", #6 → "## 4."

Wait — existing number is "1.", new ones should start at 2.

Steps (shift starts at 0):
1. Insert `## 2. Import Libraries`   before #2 (index 1): cellIndex = 1+0=1,  shift→1
2. Insert `## 3. Load Data`          before #3 (index 2): cellIndex = 2+1=3,  shift→2
3. Insert `## 4. Summary Statistics` before #6 (index 5): cellIndex = 5+2=7,  shift→3

Final notebook order: #1 (title), new ##2 header, #2 (import), new ##3 header, #3 (load), #4 (##1 existing), #5 (head), new ##4 header, #6 (describe) ✓

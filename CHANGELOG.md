## [0.3.0] — Long-Term Memory & Smart Cell Context

### New Features

#### Long-Term Memory — Preference Store
- Structured YAML-based preference registry with three scopes: **global** (`~/.jupyter-assistant/memory/global_memory.yaml`), **project**, and **notebook**
- Preferences persist across sessions and JupyterLab restarts; never stored in the notebook repo
- Each entry carries `confidence`, `evidence_count`, `consistent_count`, `source` (explicit / inferred), and `keywords` for relevance matching
- Deterministic confidence formula: evidence floor × consistency ratio × recency decay (90-day half-life) × source weight

#### Long-Term Memory — Inference Pipeline
- Pattern detection runs automatically every 10 new cell versions (configurable)
- **Priority 1 — symbol value consistency**: flags variables set to the same value in ≥ 3 independent cells (e.g. `random_state=42`)
- **Priority 2 — import frequency**: flags library aliases that appear in ≥ 3 distinct import cells (e.g. `import pandas as pd`)
- Detected patterns converted to human-readable preference entries via the Simple Tasks model (or a deterministic template fallback)

#### Long-Term Memory — Injection Pipeline
- `select_preferences()` selects relevant preferences at query time using keyword matching
- When the candidate list exceeds 10 entries and a Simple Tasks model is configured, an LLM re-ranks the candidates before injection
- Formatted memory block (§7.5) replaces the flat `preferences.md` injection in the system prompt
- **Zero-downtime migration**: existing `preferences.md` continues to be injected as a fallback until the new YAML store is populated, then archived to `preferences.md.bak`

#### Explicit preference detection
- Regex-based scanner detects preference statements in user chat messages ("always use X", "remember to Y", "I prefer Z") and stores them immediately in the preference store without any LLM call

#### Simple Tasks Model (`DS_SIMPLE_TASKS_MODEL`)
- New optional model name setting in **Settings → Routing** (alongside Chat and Completion)
- Uses the same provider as the chat model but a lighter/cheaper model for preference selection, generation, and legacy migration
- Leave blank to use keyword-only matching (no extra API calls)
- Replaces the old completion-model role for background inference tasks

#### Smart Cell Context (v0.2.5 backport, now stable)
- Structured, versioned `SummaryStore` replaces the hard 2 000-char per-cell truncation
- Per-cell summaries include: symbols defined/consumed, types, live values (from kernel snapshot), error flags, import-cell detection
- Focal cell receives full-fidelity source and output (untruncated) regardless of length
- `SummaryStore` now carries a `_meta` block tracking `versions_since_inference` and `last_inference_run`

---

### Bug Fixes

- `deploy.sh` now copies `package.json` to both install locations before the hash-update step, preventing `FileNotFoundError` on clean virtual environments

---

### Developer / Ops

- `pyyaml>=6.0` added as a core dependency (was already present transitively via JupyterLab)
- `create_simple_task_provider()` added to `varys/llm/factory.py` — uses the chat provider type with a model-name override

---

## [0.2.0] — New Release

### New Features

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- Connect any MCP-compatible server (e.g. filesystem, databases, custom APIs) through the Settings → MCP tab
- Python-native **Sequential Thinking** built-in tool — mirrors the official MCP sequential-thinking server schema without requiring Node.js; drives a multi-turn reasoning loop inside the Anthropic provider
- `MCPManager` singleton owns all server connections at startup; tools are injected into every agentic call automatically

#### Stable cell identity system
- Each notebook cell is tagged with a persistent UUID on first interaction
- Cell references survive cell insertion/deletion; no more off-by-one errors when the LLM refers to "cell #N"
- History is translated at send-time so all prior messages use the current cell numbering

#### Tags panel with built-in presets
- New **Tags** tab groups notebook cells by tag
- Ships with curated presets (EDA, modelling, data cleaning, …) that can be applied in one click

#### Skills — persona override
- A skill file can now include a `persona:` key that replaces the global system-prompt persona for that invocation
- Bundled `python_expert` skill included as a reference

#### Thread management
- Duplicate and delete threads from the thread list
- Rename guard: rejects names that collide with an existing thread

#### Per-thread notebook-aware toggle
- Each thread remembers whether the notebook context is included; toggling one thread does not affect others

#### AWS Bedrock improvements
- AWS Profile-based auth (`AWS_PROFILE`) — no hard-coded credentials needed
- Lazy credential refresh: catches `ExpiredTokenException` and retries transparently
- Token usage reported from the Converse API response

#### Inline completion
- Token-limit input in the Routing tab (default 128) lets you tune completion length
- Validation on empty provider / key / model fields prevents silent failures

#### Commands tab
- Settings → Commands lists all built-in and skill commands live, sorted alphabetically

---

### UI / UX Improvements

#### Chat bubbles
- **Cursor-style click-to-edit** on user messages — click any sent bubble to edit and re-send in place
- Chat history is correctly truncated at the edited message before re-submitting to the LLM
- User bubble width increased to **70 %** of the chat canvas; code blocks inside use `pre-wrap` instead of horizontal scroll
- Edit textarea auto-sizes to the original bubble height and is visually transparent (matches the bubble)
- Response bubble toolbar moved to the **top** of the bubble, Cursor-style, with a separator line below

#### Streaming
- Character-based adaptive drip replaces token-flush: 8 / 16 / 32 chars per tick depending on buffer depth, giving smooth, readable output at any network speed
- Chat window **auto-scrolls to bottom** on every streamed chunk (instant, not smooth-scroll)
- Reasoning / thinking panel also auto-scrolls as thinking tokens arrive

#### Notebook context chip
- `@notebook` chip redesigned as a Cursor-style `@-mention` pill in the input area
- Shows `context: ✓` / `context: ×` prefix; click toggles inclusion

#### Push-to-cell button
- Styled like a Run button; visibility is mode-gated (hidden in *Never* mode, always shown otherwise)
- `Response To Cell` dropdown replaces the old cycle button; options: Discuss / Auto / Write

#### Visual diff view
- Header, cell count, and hint text now use design tokens (`--ds-surface`, `--ds-text`, `--ds-text-dim`) so they are readable in both day and night modes
- "0 cells" badge and instructional hint are hidden when there are no pending diffs (e.g. advisory-only responses)

#### Cell output overlay
- Regular outputs labelled `[1]`, `[2]`, … and error tracebacks labelled separately
- Error cells show a red `[N] 🔴` badge in the overlay so failures are instantly visible

#### Model switcher
- Smaller font and reduced padding throughout the popup
- Custom tooltips added to all icon buttons in the interface

#### Night-mode design token system
- All component colours migrated from raw `--jp-*` JupyterLab variables to `--ds-*` design tokens
- Tokens are defined once in `.ds-chat-day` / `.ds-chat-night`; per-component night overrides removed
- Reduces night-mode text brightness by ~15 % for better readability at night

---

### Bug Fixes

- **Token spacing** (`"Greatnews"` style output): `_strip_null` in `task.py` was calling `.strip()` on every streamed token, removing the leading space that encodes word boundaries in LLM tokenisers. Fixed to `.rstrip()`.
- **Cell numbering ambiguity**: all prompts, skills, and parsers standardised to 1-based `#N` references; context sent to the LLM uses 0-based index `N-1` internally
- **Disambiguation card** shown even when `notebookAware` is off — fixed
- **Bedrock profile auth** blocking frontend validation — fixed
- **Null / blank artefacts** appearing in chat bubbles from `json_delta` events — fixed
- Night-mode code blocks: removed spurious line highlights
- Ollama `base_url` fallback when `OLLAMA_URL` is an empty string
- `OverloadedError` import guard for newer Anthropic SDK versions

---

### Developer / Ops

- `deploy.sh` targets both `pyrhenv` and `.varys` virtual environments
- Cursor rule added: deploy-and-commit checklist ensuring `varys/labextension/package.json` is always committed with the matching `remoteEntry` hash
- All LLM providers aligned to the same `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`; Anthropic and Bedrock providers unified

---
